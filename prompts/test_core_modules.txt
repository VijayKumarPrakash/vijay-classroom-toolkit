ROLE:
You are a senior Python QA engineer.

TASK:
Generate pytest unit tests for the following project.

CONTEXT:
This project contains two core modules:

1. student_manager.py
2. classroom_tools.py

They implement:
- Student storage by section
- Random selection of students
- Group formation logic

Go through the entire source code.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Import the real classes and functions
2. Match the actual public API
3. Cover normal and edge cases
4. Use pytest style
5. Do not mock core logic
6. Assume in-memory storage

INPUT:
Look at code under src/. There should be two files:
classroom_tools.py
student_manager.py
Go through these and build robust tests for them.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Generate two separate Python files in the tests/ directory:

1. tests/test_student_manager.py
   - Should contain pytest tests for student_manager.py
   - Must be fully runnable

2. tests/test_classroom_tools.py
   - Should contain pytest tests for classroom_tools.py
   - Must be fully runnable

Do not include any text outside the Python code in the files.  
Do not wrap code in markdown or quotes.
