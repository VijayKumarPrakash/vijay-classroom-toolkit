ROLE:
You are a senior backend engineer specializing in FastAPI and clean architecture.

TASK:
Generate a FastAPI backend called main.py for Vijay's Classroom Toolkit.
Fix import paths for necessary modules


SYSTEM CONTEXT:
There are two existing modules:
- student_manager.py (manages students and sections)
- classroom_tools.py (implements spin wheel and grouping)

These modules are located in src/.

The API must use these modules and not reimplement their logic.
Make sure appropriate imports are made and that you are not hallucinating. Check the source code first before implementing the APIs.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Initialize: two modules for student management and classroom tools

2. Define Pydantic models for:
   - StudentCreate
   - GroupRequest

3. Expose endpoints:

   POST /students
     Add a student

   GET /sections/{section_id}
     Return students in section

   POST /spin/{section_id}
     Randomly select student

   POST /groups
     Create groups

4. Handle errors with HTTPException

5. Enable CORS for localhost frontend

6. Include docstrings and comments

CONSTRAINTS:
- Python 3.10+
- Use FastAPI
- No external business logic
- Clean modular structure

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return only valid Python code for backend/main.py.
